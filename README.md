# Assignments
This repo contains some of the assignments and projects for my undergraduate courses.

I started studying at Illinois Tech in Fall of 2014, switching my major from Information Technology and Management to Computer Science after my first semester.

During my time at IIT, I studied abroad at Hanyang University in Seoul, South Korea for two semesters, which was an amazing opportunity not only to study at a top Korean university, but also to explore Korean culture and places.

This repository does not have all of the things I worked on during my studies, but if any of these files help you have an easier time during your studies, I will feel happy :)
